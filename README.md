# Hello!

## How to run this project

There are three ways you can start it. For convenience, I included the built frontend `dist` folder, so you don't have to build it yourself.

### Run the built stuff

1) In the root of the folder, run `npm run start`

OR

### Run two dev servers 

1) From the root of the folder, run `npm run dev`
2) In another terminal, from the `frontend` folder, run `npm run dev`

### Build it yourself

1) From the `frontend` folder, run `npm run build`
2) Run `cd ../ && npm run start`
